## 👩‍💻 Who Am I?
I'm currently pursuing a **Bachelor’s in Cybersecurity** from **Air University Islamabad** (CGPA: 3.13).  
My curiosity drives me towards uncovering vulnerabilities and strengthening security measures through practical tools like **Wireshark, Burp Suite, and Kali Linux.** I am actively involved in CTFs, academic projects, and security societies to sharpen my technical edge.

I believe in continuous learning, hands-on practice, and contributing to the cybersecurity community through write-ups and tools.
